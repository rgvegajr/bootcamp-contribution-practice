# bootcamp-contribution-practice
A repository for the UM Coding Bootcamp Students to practice contributing with GitHub


# Hello Everyone
I got a little bored while practicing and thought of a neat project we could all do together at our own pace & free time.

I've recycled some code I used for my personal website into something we could all work on together and created a GitHub Repo for everyone to access.

With this project we can all practice some super basic HTML and also practice cloning, editing, committing, and finally pushing to GitHub and then submitting a PR request to contribute altogether to a single GitHub repo.

It is extremely straight forward and simple.
All the directions are inside the `index.html` file as `comments`.
Be sure to read them all thoroughly to avoid any unnecessary issues.

Don't worry I tried to make it as simple as copy, paste, & edit.

## Step 1 - Fork It
Make sure click the tiny "fork" button on the top right to fork a copy to your own repo.

## Step 2 - Clone It
Clone your forked repo onto your computer using Git

## Step 3 - Edit!
Open the `index.html` into your text editor and be sure to read all the `comments` i've place dinside the file so you can properly make add your info to the page.

## Step 4 - Add, Commit, Push
Stage your changes using the "add" command.
Commit them with a brief message as to what you added.
Then Push your changes back to your origin (Your forked repo)

## Step 5 - Pull Request - Merge To Master
Submit a PR Request so I can merge it with the original repo.

## DISCLAIMER
Always make sure you "pull" before making any changes or pushes to ensure you've got the most up to date files.
Your fork may no longer match the master once additional changes are made.
If you have questions - search github for how to `sync your fork with the master.`
